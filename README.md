## What Are Datapacks?
Datapacks are folders you can place into the datapacks folder of a Minecraft world to modify or enhance gameplay. They offer a range of possibilities, including:

- **Lootables**: Adjust the items you receive from chests in structures (e.g., dungeons) or mobs.
- **Structures**: Alter or add structures like desert temples.
- **Crafting Recipes**: Customize the recipes for crafting items.
- **Custom Advancements**: Reward players for completing specific objectives.
- **Predicates**: Introduced in version 1.15, these help detect certain conditions that NBT data cannot.
- **Function Files**: Store collections of commands that can be executed together. From the main loop file, additional function files can be called.

The beauty of function files lies in their use of standard Minecraft commands. With basic command knowledge, you can create a datapack in minutes. While seemingly limited, combining function files with a resource pack can result in remarkable creations like:

- Fully operational tanks  
- Custom mobs  
- A magic wand that shoots fireballs  
- Even an entirely new dimension  



## Why Combat Logging is a Problem
Combat logging disrupts the gaming experience in several ways:

1. **Unfair Gameplay**: It lets players escape from fights without facing consequences, frustrating those who play fairly.
2. **Server Instability**: Frequent logging disrupts server performance and may lead to lag.
3. **Negative Community Impact**: It creates a toxic environment, leading to distrust and conflict.
4. **Progress Disruption**: Players who combat log can hinder others, especially in scenarios involving valuable resources.

Combat logging datapacks address these issues by discouraging or penalizing this behavior, ensuring a more balanced and enjoyable experience.



## What is Combat Logging?
Combat logging in Minecraft refers to players disconnecting from the server during combat to avoid outcomes like:

- Dropping items  
- Losing experience  
- Dying  

This practice is widely seen as unfair and disrupts the game’s natural flow.



## Impact on Gameplay and Multiplayer Experience

- **Unfair Advantage**: Avoiding item loss or experience grants combat loggers an edge over rule-following players.  
- **Disrupted Game Flow**: Logging out mid-combat breaks the immersion and continuity of battles.  
- **Community Trust Issues**: It fosters a toxic environment and mistrust among players.  
- **Server Performance**: Frequent disconnections strain server resources, leading to lag.

### Common Scenarios Where Combat Logging Occurs:
- **PvP Battles**: Players log out to avoid defeat in player-vs-player confrontations.  
- **Hostile Mobs**: Logging out prevents death or item loss from strong mobs.  
- **Raids and Sieges**: Players avoid capture or death during large-scale events.  
- **Unexpected Encounters**: Surprise attacks or ambushes prompt players to disconnect.  
- **Resource Protection**: Valuable items are safeguarded when players log out during risky situations.  

Combat logging datapacks mitigate these issues by implementing rules and penalties, fostering a fairer multiplayer environment.



## Why Use Combat Logging Datapacks?

- **Fair Play**: Ensures all players follow the same rules.  
- **Improved Gameplay**: Keeps battles immersive and uninterrupted.  
- **Community Integrity**: Discourages disruptive behaviors, promoting a healthier gaming environment.  



## How Datapacks Enhance the Multiplayer Experience

- **Consistent Rules**: Enforces uniform guidelines, reducing disputes.  
- **Enhanced Challenges**: Encourages players to improve strategies for more rewarding gameplay.  
- **Balanced Competitions**: Ensures victories and defeats are earned fairly.  
- **Community Engagement**: A stable multiplayer environment fosters an active and engaged player base.
